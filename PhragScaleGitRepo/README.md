# Phrag_Scale_Proj
Phragmites australis and Nipponaclerda biwakoensis invasion is explored through plant-microbe-insect interactions.

Data came from a trip to the Birdfoot Delta in Southern Louisiana on September 17, 2018. They were collected and entered into spreadsheet by Caitlin Bumby.

Data were collected in the Passe A Loutre Wildlife State Management area in the Mississippi River Delta Region in Louisiana. 80 individuals of *Phragmites australis* were collected at two separate sites, each with two paired plots: One of the Delta-type haplotype (M1) and one of the European-type haplotype (M). At the time of collection, water depth (in cm) for each ramet as well as stand density per `1/4m^2` (number of live individuals, number of dead individuals, total number of individuals) were also collected. In the lab, individual stem height (in cm) was measured. The average number of scales insects per node was determined by counting the number of scales every third node and then averaging that number. Additionally, the number of nodes per plant was collected. The number of scales were counted by hand for twelve of the samples (EU2-1 through EU2-6 and D2-1 through D2-6) which is why there is a counted_scales column. 

Goal is to determine whether there is a significant difference between the haplotypes and within the haplotypes in terms of infestedness by *N. biwakoensis*. From there, I would like to explore some of the other data collected regarding stand densities, and water depth, in terms of infestedness.

Further metagenomics data will be collected to determine whether there is a significant difference in microbial community composition between and within the haplotypes with level of infestedness as a factor.
